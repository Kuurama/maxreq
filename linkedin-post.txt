Multi-Language API Server Performance Comparison – The Business Impact

The performance gap between the fastest (Rust) and the slowest (PHP) is 14.6x.

This is a comparison of API servers, not general web development.

Real-world implications:

    One Rust server can handle the same throughput as 14.6 PHP servers.

    Cloud costs scale proportionally with server count.

    Carbon footprint is directly linked to computational efficiency.

Key Takeaways:

    Compiled languages lead in high-performance API scenarios.

    Go stands out as a balanced choice, offering near-Rust performance with simpler syntax.

    C# maintains a simple codebase with strong performance; Blazor supports full stack development entirely in C# (no JavaScript).

    AI tools now make language migrations more feasible—build in your preferred language, then convert to a more efficient technology.

    Technology choices have significant environmental and cost implications.

Choosing the right technology stack today affects not just developer productivity, but also cost and environmental responsibility.

With rising cloud costs and increasing focus on sustainability, it’s important to understand the real performance impact of programming languages on API development.

The Experiment
Using AI (Claude Sonnet 4), I built eight identical authentication APIs in different languages, each with:

    Database interactions (SQLite)

    JSON request/response handling

    Comprehensive error handling

Test Environment: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8 cores, 16 threads), Windows 10
Methodology: 100,000 requests, 16 concurrent connections

The Results (Requests per Second):

Compiled Languages (Native Performance)

    Rust: 17,887 req/s – Zero-cost abstractions deliver maximum speed

    Go: 12,049 req/s – Excellent balance of performance and simplicity

    C#/.NET: 7,417 req/s – Strong enterprise-grade performance

Compiled/JIT Languages

    C++: 5,652 req/s – Fast but not recommended for web APIs

    Java: 4,527 req/s – JVM optimization pays off

Interpreted/Dynamic Languages

    Python: 2,112 req/s – FastAPI surprises with strong async capabilities

    Node.js: 2,076 req/s – V8 engine delivers decent async performance

    PHP: 1,227 req/s – Traditional, adequate for standard web apps

AI tools are making it easier to move between technologies, helping teams achieve better performance and cost savings.
